## Methodology

### Monte Carlo Process
1. **Load Project Network**: Parse tasks with dependencies from CSV
2. **Generate Random Durations**: Sample from PERT distributions for each task
3. **Calculate Critical Path**: Determine project duration and critical tasks
4. **Repeat 10,000 Times**: Build statistical distribution of outcomes
5. **Analyze Results**: Extract percentiles, criticality, and sensitivity metrics

### Critical Path Analysis
- **Dynamic Calculation**: Critical path determined for each simulation run
- **Criticality Percentage**: How often each task appears on critical path
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Correlation between task duration and project duration

### PERT Distribution
Uses Program Evaluation and Review Technique for realistic duration modeling:
- **Expected Duration**: (O + 4Ã—M + P) Ã· 6
- **Beta Distribution**: Accounts for skewness in estimates
- **Realistic Uncertainty**: Captures real-world estimation variance

## Practical Usage

### For Project Managers
1. **Planning**: Use P75 (75th percentile) for realistic project schedules
2. **Commitments**: Use P90 (90th percentile) for external commitments
3. **Resource Allocation**: Focus best resources on high-criticality tasks
4. **Risk Management**: Monitor high-impact tasks from sensitivity analysis

### For Stakeholders
1. **Timeline Communication**: "75% chance of delivery by [P75 date]"
2. **Risk Discussion**: Present multiple scenarios with probabilities
3. **Decision Support**: Quantify impact of scope/resource changes
4. **Progress Tracking**: Compare actual progress to predicted ranges

### For Teams
1. **Priority Setting**: Focus on critical path tasks first
2. **Estimation Improvement**: Track actual vs. estimated durations
3. **Risk Awareness**: Understand which tasks drive project delays
4. **Continuous Learning**: Build estimation expertise over time

## Advanced Features

### Continuous Calibration
- Track actual vs. estimated durations for completed tasks
- Identify systematic estimation biases by category
- Improve future estimates using historical patterns
- Build organizational estimation knowledge base

### Scenario Analysis
- Run simulations with different assumptions

- Structured data format for custom analysis and reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Network not loaded" error:**
- Ensure `data/project_tasks.csv` exists and is properly formatted
- Check that all predecessor task IDs exist in the file

**Unrealistic results:**
- Verify three-point estimates are reasonable (P should be 1.5-3x larger than O)
- Check for circular dependencies in task network
- Ensure task durations are in consistent units (days)

**Missing CSV files:**
- Check file permissions in output directory
- Verify simulation completed successfully
- Look for error messages in console output
